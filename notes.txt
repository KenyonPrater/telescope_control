######### things to do ##########
note that the precision on these scans is not perfect, figure 
out what precision is required, i think its coming from rounding 
errors and conversion between cts and degrees.

#### resolved - moveto function takes the long way round when shifting elevation

add acceleration and deceleration, decide if speed 
should be set or variable

find absolute position of encoder, right not there is no reference
point

if (MaxEl - MinEl + stepSize)/stepSize is not an even integer it could
fail

code to keep telescope from pointing below horizon may need higher limit than 0

it might be possible/better to combine the forward and backward passes into one block of code, use -1**i and a list for min/max az then do list[i % 2] or something like that

for azscan think about the best way to do iput parameters for rotation, i.e. distance based on distance, time, or rotations, have each option as a button?

make a move function that is used in all other scripts, put it in moveto, equivilent of qichengs arrow buttons

cant do more than one rotation in azscan? 

changing the speed of az motor creates an error...except now it doesnt

add elevation logic to not let azscan go below horizon
