note that the precision on these scans is not perfect, figure 
out what precision is required, i think its coming from rounding 
errors and conversion between cts and degrees.

#### resolved - moveto function takes the long way round when shifting elevation

add acceleration and deceleration to all motion control, decide if speed 
should be set or variable

find absolute position of encoder, right now there is no reference
point

### resolved - if (MaxEl - MinEl + stepSize)/stepSize is not an even integer it could
fail

code to keep telescope from pointing below horizon may need higher limit than 0

it might be possible/better to combine the forward and backward passes into one block of code, use -1**i and a list for min/max az then do list[i % 2] or something like that

for azscan think about the best way to do iput parameters for rotation, i.e. distance based on distance, time, or rotations, have each option as a button?

****make a move function that is used in all other scripts, put it in moveto, equivilent of qichengs arrow buttons *******

cant do more than one rotation in azscan? 

changing the speed of az motor creates an error...except now it doesnt

add elevation logic to not let azscan go below horizon, at some point

you could define some function that sets the absolute zero at some random position, then always return to that position at the end of each session, that way when it turns on the next time the zero will always be the same, whereas now zero is wherever it happens to be positioned when it turns on

figure out if there is a better way to convert az el coordinates outputted by ephem into degrees

put in logic that allows for different scan times at each elevation

potentially make comment positions consistant

if I stick with time method, put in logic to convert time to distance

eventually you should figure out how to connect to the controller in some macro program, and not have to do it in each individual script, this will probably come naturally with the interface.

moveto speed and scan speed should probably be different

add functionality to move to starting elevation in scanAZ

forward/backward pass # comments are incorrect, jumps form 1 to 3, figure out the right way to do this

putting moveto.location in azScan in different locations in script effects functionality, might have to do with setting acceleration and deceleration before vs after moveto


Think about how best to display ouput, and what output we want to display (gui related)
