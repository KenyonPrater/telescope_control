note that the precision on these scans is not perfect, figure

errors and conversion between cts and degrees.

# resolved - moveto function takes the long way round when shifting elevation

add acceleration and deceleration, decide if speed 
should be set or variable

find absolute position of encoder, right not there is no reference
point

if (MaxEl - MinEl + stepSize)/stepSize is not an even integer it could
fail

code to keep telescope from pointing below horizon may need higher limit than 0
